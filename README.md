# sumtree
A small primer on sumtrees

I encountered sum trees first when reading about DQN and the concept of priority buffers. Before that, I had not encountered sum trees despite being a pretty simple form of binary tree. This repository is an exploration of sum trees with a personal implementation of both vanilla sum trees and sum-tree-based priority buffers for use in RL.
